<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Prolog is a programming language that originated in the early 1970s and was initially developed for natural language processing. It became popular with the introduction of interpreters for various computer systems. Prolog evolved from being interpreted to a semi-interpreted language, thanks to the creation of a compiler. Its adoption for the fifth-generation computer project and the establishment of an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 13211-1) further contributed to its widespread use.</p>
<p>Prolog belongs to the paradigm of logic and declarative languages, which sets it apart significantly from more popular languages such as FORTRAN, Pascal, C, or Java. In the aforementioned programming languages, instructions are typically executed sequentially, one after another, in the same order as they are written. The order only changes when a control instruction is reached (such as a loop, conditional statement, or transfer).</p>
<p>Prolog programs consist of Horn clauses that represent &quot;modus ponens&quot; rules, meaning &quot;If the antecedent is true, then the consequent is true.&quot; However, the way Horn clauses are written is the opposite of the usual convention. First, the consequent is written, followed by the antecedent. The antecedent can be a conjunction of conditions referred to as a sequence of goals. Each goal is separated by a comma and can be seen as similar to an instruction or procedure call in imperative languages. In Prolog, there are no control instructions. Execution is based on two concepts: unification and backtracking.</p>
<p>Thanks to unification, each goal determines a subset of clauses that can be executed. Each of these subsets is called a choice point. Prolog selects the first choice point and continues executing the program until determining whether the goal is true or false. If the goal is false, backtracking comes into play. Backtracking involves undoing everything that has been executed, placing the program in the same state it was in just before reaching the choice point. Then, the next pending choice point is taken, and the process is repeated. All goals conclude their execution either successfully (&quot;true&quot;) or unsuccessfully (&quot;false&quot;).</p></div>

<h3><a name="Data_types"></a>Data types</h3>
<p>Prolog has a single data type called &quot;term.&quot; Terms can be atoms, numbers, variables, or compound terms. Atoms are general-purpose names with no built-in meaning. Examples of atoms are x, red, 'Taco', and 'some atom'. Numbers can be floats or integers. Prolog systems compatible with the ISO standard can check the &quot;bounded&quot; flag. Most major Prolog systems support integers of arbitrary length. Variables are represented by strings consisting of letters, numbers, and underscores. They start with an uppercase letter or underscore. Variables closely resemble logic variables as they act as placeholders for any term.</p>
<p>A compound term consists of an atom called a &quot;functor&quot; and a number of &quot;arguments,&quot; which are themselves terms. Compound terms are typically written as a functor followed by a list of comma-separated argument terms enclosed in parentheses. The number of arguments is referred to as the term's &quot;arity.&quot; An atom can be seen as a compound term with arity zero. For example, person_friends(zelda, [tom, jim]) is a compound term.</p>
<p>Special cases of compound terms: - Lists: An ordered collection of terms denoted by square brackets. The terms are separated by commas. An empty list is represented by []. For instance, [1, 2, 3] or [red, green, blue].</p>
<p>- Strings: A sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. Depending on the value of the Prolog flag &quot;double_quotes,&quot; a string can be treated as a list of character codes, a list of single-character atoms, or simply as an atom. For example, &quot;to be, or not to be&quot;.</p>
<p>ISO Prolog provides predicates like atom/1, number/1, integer/1, and float/1 for type-checking.</p></div>

<h3><a name="Rules_and_Facts"></a>Rules and Facts</h3>
<p>Prolog programs define relationships using clauses. Pure Prolog is limited to Horn clauses. There are two types of clauses: facts and rules. A rule has the form:</p>
<p>Head :- Body.</p>
<p>This signifies that &quot;Head is true if Body is true.&quot; The body of a rule consists of calls to predicates, which are the goals of the rule. The built-in logical operator ,/2 (denoting a binary operator named &quot;,&quot;) represents the conjunction of goals, while ;/2 represents disjunction. Conjunctions and disjunctions can only appear in the body of a rule, not in the head.</p>
<p>Clauses with empty bodies are referred to as facts. An example of a fact is:</p>
<p>cat(tom).</p>
<p>This is equivalent to the rule:</p>
<p>cat(tom) :- true.</p>
<p>The built-in predicate true/0 is always true. Based on the given fact, we can ask: Is tom a cat?</p>
<p>?- cat(tom).</p>
<p>The answer is &quot;Yes.&quot; We can also inquire about the things that are cats: What things are cats?</p>
<p>?- cat(X).</p>
<p>The answer is X = tom. Clauses with bodies are known as rules. An example of a rule is:</p>
<p>animal(X) :- cat(X).</p>
<p>If we include this rule and ask what things are animals:</p>
<p>?- animal(X).</p>
<p>The answer is X = tom.</p>
<p>Due to the relational nature of many built-in predicates, they can be used in multiple ways. For instance, length/2 can be used to find the length of a list (length(List, L)) given a list List, generate a list skeleton of a specific length (length(X, 5)), or generate both list skeletons and their lengths together (length(X, L)). Similarly, append/3 can be employed to append two lists (append(ListA, ListB, X)) given lists ListA and ListB, or split a given list into parts (append(X, Y, List)) given a list List. Consequently, a relatively small set of library predicates is sufficient for many Prolog programs.</p>
<p>As a general-purpose language, Prolog also offers various built-in predicates for common tasks such as input/output, graphics usage, and interaction with the operating system. These predicates do not have relational meanings and are only useful for their system-related effects. For example, the predicate write/1 displays a term on the screen.</p></div>

<h3><a name="Execution"></a>Execution</h3>
<p>To run a Prolog program, you start by entering a single goal called the query. The Prolog engine then attempts to find a resolution refutation of the negated query. Prolog uses a method called SLD resolution. If the negated query can be proven false, it means that the original query, with the appropriate variable assignments, is a logical consequence of the program. In this case, all the variable assignments are displayed, and the query is considered successful. </p>
<p>Operatively, Prolog's execution strategy can be seen as an extension of function calls in other programming languages. One difference is that multiple clause heads can match a particular call. When this happens, the system creates a choice point, where it matches the goal with the clause head of the first alternative and proceeds with that alternative's goals. If any goal fails during program execution, all variable assignments made since the most recent choice point was created are undone, and execution continues with the next alternative of that choice point. This strategy is known as chronological backtracking. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">        mother_child(trude, sally).
        father_child(tom, sally).
        father_child(tom, erica).
        father_child(mike, tom).
        sibling(X, Y)      :- parent_child(Z, X), parent_child(Z, Y).
        parent_child(X, Y) :- father_child(X, Y).
        parent_child(X, Y) :- mother_child(X, Y).
</pre></div>
<p>Executing the following query will yield a true result:</p>
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">        ?- sibling(sally, erica).
        Yes
</pre></div>
<p>Here's how the result is obtained: Initially, the only clause head that matches the query `sibling(sally, erica)` is the first one. Therefore, proving the query is equivalent to proving the body of that clause with the appropriate variable assignments, which in this case is the conjunction `(parent_child(Z,sally), parent_child(Z,erica))`. The next goal to prove is the leftmost part of this conjunction: `parent_child(Z, sally)`. There are two clause heads that match this goal. The system creates a choice point and attempts the first alternative, which has the body `father_child(Z, sally)`. This goal can be proven with the fact `father_child(tom, sally)`, leading to the assignment `Z = tom`. The next goal to prove is the second part of the conjunction: `parent_child(tom, erica)`. This is also proven by the corresponding fact. Since all the goals have been proven, the query is considered successful. As the query doesn't contain any variables, no assignments are displayed to the user. </p>
<p>A query that includes variables, such as `?- father_child(Father, Child).`, will list all valid answers through backtracking. Note that with the given code, the query `?- sibling(sally, sally).` also succeeds. If there are specific restrictions, additional goals should be added to the code.</p>
<p>ISO Prolog is a technical standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It consists of two main parts. The first part, ISO/IEC 13211-1, was published in 1995 with the goal of standardizing the core elements of Prolog. This standard aims to bring clarity and remove ambiguities in the language, making it easier to write portable programs. Additionally, there have been three corrigenda issued: Cor.1:2007, Cor.2:2012, and Cor.3:2017.</p>
<p>The second part, ISO/IEC 13211-2, was published in 2000 and provides support for modules within the standard. The maintenance of this standard is overseen by the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG17 working group. In the United States, the US Technical Advisory Group for the standard is ANSI X3J17.</p></div></div>
