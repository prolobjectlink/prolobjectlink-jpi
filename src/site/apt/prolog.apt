Prolog Programming
 
* Prolog Language
 
 	The Prolog belongs to the declarative programming languages paradigm. the Prolog
 	programs are based on valid conclusion over facts. Prolog is a LP 
 	language specially indicated to modeling problems that imply objects and relations
 	among objects. Prolog have simple syntax, is weakness typed, have simples data 
 	structures, support recursion and is extensible. One Prolog program have two basic
 	components or clause, facts and rules.
 	
 	All Prolog programs are a succession of clauses where every clause end with dot 
 	character. They are two kind of clauses, Facts and Rules. Every Prolog clause have
 	two components, one head and one body. Facts are the case where the clause only have
 	head component but don't have body and they are used to indicate things unconditionally
 	true about some domain. Rule have head and body and both are separate by neck operator
 	(:-). Rules are used to indicate things conditionally true about some domain. Neck
 	operator semantic denote that one condition should be satisfy by the clause head to be
 	true. The clause body specify the condition order to verify for the conclusion or head.
