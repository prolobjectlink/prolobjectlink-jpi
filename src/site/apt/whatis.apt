What is

* Introduction

	Java Prolog Interface (JPI) is an Application Provider Interface (API) 
	for interaction between Java and Prolog programming languages. Is a 
	bidirectional interface that communicate Java applications with Prolog
	program or database and Prolog procedures with Java class and methods.
	
	JPI is an abstraction layer over concrete prolog drivers over Prolog 
	Engines. This API define all mechanism to interact with any Prolog Engine
	and maintain the application independent to a specific underlying engine.
	JPI have several connectors to open source prolog engines like SWI, YAP,
	XSB native engines and tuProlog, jTrolog, jLog Java based prolog engines.
	
	JPI study all related Java-Prolog integration libraries and take the 
	betters features from each solution with the propose to achieve a common
	integration interface. The last feature allows switch the under laying 
	Prolog Engine driver and the application code still be the same.
	
	JPI run over any Java Virtual Machine that support Java SE 5 or above.
	The project was tested over HotSpot and Open J9 Virtual Machines
	over Operating Systems like Windows (7,8,10), Linux (Debian, Ubuntu) and 
	Mac OS X. Can be deployed on Servlets Containers like Jetty, Tomcat or 
	Glassfish Application Server. JPI can be include in any Java Project using the commonest Java Integration
	Development Enviroment (IDE) like Eclipse, Netbeans, IntellijIDEA and so on.
	
	JPI is developed and maintained by Prolobjectlink Project an open source 
	initiative for build logic based applications using Prolog like fundamental
	Logic Programming Language in the persistence layer and application programming.
