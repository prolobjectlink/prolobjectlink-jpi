/**
 * Represent the Prolog atom data type. Prolog atoms are can be of two kinds
 * simple or complex. Simple atoms are defined like a single alpha numeric word
 * that begin like initial lower case character. The complex atom are define
 * like any character sequence that begin and end with simple quotes. The string
 * passed to build a simple atoms should be match with [a-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*
 * regular expression. If the string passed to build an atom don't match with
 * the before mentioned regular expression the atom constructor can be capable
 * of create a complex atom automatically. For complex atom the string value can
 * have the quotes or just can be absent. The printed string representation of
 * the complex atom implementation set the quotes if they are needed.
