/**
 * <p>
 * Ancestor prolog data type. All Prolog data types {@link PrologAtom},
 * {@link PrologNumber}, {@link PrologList}, {@link PrologStructure} and
 * {@link PrologVariable} are derived from this class. All before mentioned
 * classes extends from this class the commons responsibilities. Extends from
 * {@link Comparable} to compare the current term with another term based on
 * Standard Order.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Prolog Provider is the mechanism to create a new Prolog terms invoking
 * the correspondent methods. {@link PrologProvider#newAtom(String)} for atoms,
 * {@link PrologProvider#newStructure(String, PrologTerm...)} for structures,
 * {@link PrologProvider#newVariable(String, int)} for variables and so on.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * With {@link #getType()} the term type can be retrieve. Every term have a type
 * defined in {@link PrologTermType}. The prolog type have by definition one
 * order (Standard Order) where Variables &lt; Atoms &lt; Numbers &lt;
 * Compounds. This order is usable to compare two terms.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Prolog terms have two specials properties, the functor and the arity. Functor
 * is the compound term or atom name and arity is the number of arguments
 * present in the compound terms. Variable and Number don't have this
 * properties. This properties are accessible from {@link #getArity()} and
 * {@link #getFunctor()} methods. Variable and Number raise an
 * {@link ArityError} and {@link FunctorError} respectively. Based on functor
 * and arity atoms and compound terms have a predicate indicator that is the
 * signature for the term. The term indicator is an string formed by the
 * concatenation of {@link #getFunctor()} and {@link #getArity()} separated by
 * slash.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The methods {@link #getArguments()} and {@link #getArgument(int)} allow
 * retrieve the arguments and the some specific arguments for compounds terms
 * respectively. For atomics terms {@link #getArguments()} return an empty term
 * array and {@link #getArgument(int)} raise a
 * {@link ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException} because don't have arguments. For this
 * cases is a good practice check compound terms before invoke this methods.
