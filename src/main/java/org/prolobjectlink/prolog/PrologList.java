 * <p>
 * Represent prolog list compound term. List are an special compound term that
 * have like functor a dot (.) and arity equals 2. Prolog list are recursively
 * defined. The first item in the list is referred like list head and the second
 * item list tail. The list tail can be another list that contains head and
 * tail. An special list case is the empty list denoted by no items brackets
 * ([]). The arity for this empty list is zero.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Prolog Provider is the mechanism to create a new Prolog structures
 * invoking {@link PrologProvider#newList()} for empty list or
 * {@link PrologProvider#newList(PrologTerm)} for one item list or
 * {@link PrologProvider#newList(PrologTerm[])} for many items.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Two list are equals if and only if are list and have equals arguments. List
 * terms unify only with the same arguments list, with free variable or with
 * lists where your arguments unify.
 * </p>

 * PrologInteger two = provider.newInteger(2);
 * PrologInteger three = provider.newInteger(3);
 * PrologList list = provider.newList(new PrologTerm[] { one, two, three });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * PrologList implement {@link Iterable} interface to be used in for each
 * sentence iterating over every element present in the list.
