/**
 * <p>
 * Prolog clause builder to create prolog clauses. The mechanism to create a new
 * clause builder is using {@link PrologEngine#newClauseBuilder()}. The clause
 * builder emulate the clause creation process. After define all participant
 * terms with the {@link #begin(PrologTerm)} method, we specify the head of the
 * clause.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the clause is a rule, after head definition, the clause body is created
 * with {@link #neck(PrologTerm)} for the first term in the clause body. If the
 * clause body have more terms, they are created using
 * {@link #comma(PrologTerm)} for every one.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clause builder have a {@link #getClauseString()} for string representation of
 * the clause in progress. After clause definition this builder have
 * {@link #asserta()},{@link #assertz()},{@link #clause()},{@link #retract()}
 * that use the wrapped engine invoking the correspondent methods for check,
 * insert or remove clause respectively.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * PrologStructure blackZ = provider.newStructure("black", z);
 * PrologStructure brownZ = provider.newStructure("brown", z);
 * PrologClauseBuilder builder = engine.newClauseBuilder();
 * builder.begin(darkZ).neck(blackZ).assertz();
 * builder.begin(darkZ).neck(brownZ).assertz();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Prolog result.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * dark(Z) :- 
 *	black(Z).
 * dark(Z) :- 
 *	brown(Z).
