/**
 * Prolog thread is a thread of execution in a program. The Java Virtual Machine
 * allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running
 * concurrently.
 * 
 * Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are executed in
 * preference to threads with lower priority. Each thread may or may not also be
 * marked as a daemon. When code running in some thread creates a new Thread
 * object, the new thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority
 * of the creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the creating
 * thread is a daemon.
