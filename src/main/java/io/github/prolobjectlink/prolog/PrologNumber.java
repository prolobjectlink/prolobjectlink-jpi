/**
 * <p>
 * Represent all Prolog number data type. Is an abstract class that contains all
 * commons method related to number data types. In Prolog the number data types
 * are Integer and Float. Some Prolog implementations have and extension for
 * this legacy data types. They are Long (Large Integer Number) and Double
 * (Double precision Floating Point Number). For Prolog implementations that no
 * have support for Long and Double data types, they are implement this classes
 * holding a Prolog integer for Long case and Prolog float for Double case.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Two Prolog integers numbers are equals if and only if they are integers
 * number and have the same value.Two Prolog integers numbers unify if are
 * equals or at least one PrologTerm is a free variable Two Prolog floats
 * numbers are equals if and only if they are floats number and have the same
 * value.Two Prolog floats numbers unify if are equals or at least one
 * PrologTerm is a free variable Two Prolog longs numbers are equals if and only
 * if they are longs number and have the same value.Two Prolog longs numbers
 * unify if are equals or at least one PrologTerm is a free variable Two Prolog
 * doubles numbers are equals if and only if they are doubles number and have
 * the same value.Two Prolog doubles numbers unify if are equals or at least one
 * PrologTerm is a free variable
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some Prolog implementations consider that integers and longs are equals if
 * they have the same value and unify if have the same value or at least one
 * PrologTerm is a free variable. Some Prolog implementations consider that
 * floats and double are equals if they have the same value and unify if have
