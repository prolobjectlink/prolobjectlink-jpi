/**

 * Represent structured prolog compound term. Prolog structures consist in a
 * relation the functor (structure name) and arguments enclosed between
 * parenthesis.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Prolog Provider is the mechanism to create a new Prolog structures
 * invoking {@link PrologProvider#newStructure(String, PrologTerm...)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Two structures are equals if and only if are structure and have equals
 * functor and arguments. Structures terms unify only with same functor and
 * arguments structures, with free variable or with with structures where your
 * arguments unify if they have the same functor and arity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Structures have a special property named arity that means the number of
 * arguments present in the structure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are two special structures term. They are expressions (Two arguments
 * structure term with operator functor) and atoms (functor with zero
 * arguments). For the first special case must be used
 * {@link PrologProvider#newStructure(PrologTerm, String, PrologTerm)}
 * specifying operands like arguments and operator like functor. For the second
 * special case must be used {@link PrologProvider#newAtom(String)} specifying
 * functor only.
