 * Prolog term that represent variable data type. Prolog variables are created

 * {@link PrologProvider#newVariable(String, int)} for named variables. The
 * Prolog variables can be used and reused because they remain in java heap. You
 * can instantiate a prolog variable and used it any times in the same clause
 * because refer to same variable every time.
