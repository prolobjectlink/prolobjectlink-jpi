/**
 * <p>
 * Prolog clause is composed by two prolog terms that define a prolog clause,
 * the head and the body. This representation consider the prolog clause body
 * like a single term. If the body is a conjunctive set of terms, the body is an
 * structure with functor/arity (,/2) and the first argument is the first
 * element in the conjunction and the rest is a recursive functor/arity (,/2).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The functor and arity for the clause is given from head term functor and
 * arity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class define some properties for commons prolog clause implementations.
 * They are boolean flags that indicate if the prolog clause is dynamic
 * multifile and discontiguos.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class have several methods to access to the clause components and
 * retrieve some clause properties and information about it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Additionally this class contains a prolog provider reference for build terms
 * in some operations.
 * </p>
