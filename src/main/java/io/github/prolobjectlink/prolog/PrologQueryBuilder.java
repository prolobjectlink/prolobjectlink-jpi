/**
 * Prolog query builder to create prolog queries. The mechanism to create a new
 * query builder is using {@link PrologEngine#newQueryBuilder()}. The query
 * builder emulate the query creation process. After define all participant
 * terms with the {@link #begin(PrologTerm)} method, we specify the first term
 * in the query. If the query have more terms, they are created using
 * {@link #comma(PrologTerm)} for every one. Clause builder have a
 * {@link #getQueryString()} for string representation of the clause in
 * progress. After clause definition this builder have {@link #query()} method
 * that create the final query instance ready to be used.
 *
