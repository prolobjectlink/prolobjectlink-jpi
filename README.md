Java Prolog Interface (JPI) is an Application Provider Interface (API) for interaction between Java and Prolog programming languages. Is a bidirectional interface that communicate Java applications with Prolog program or database and Prolog procedures with Java class and methods.

JPI is an abstraction layer over concrete prolog drivers over Prolog Engines. This API define all mechanism to interact with any Prolog Engine and maintain the application independent to a specific underlying engine. JPI have several connectors to open source prolog engines like SWI, YAP, XSB native engines and tuProlog, jTrolog, jLog Java based prolog engines.

JPI study all related Java-Prolog integration libraries and take the betters features from each solution with the propose to achieve a common integration interface. The last feature allows switch the under laying Prolog Engine driver and the application code still be the same.

JPI run over any Java Virtual Machine that support Java SE 5 or above. The project was tested over HotSpot and Open J9 Virtual Machines over Operating Systems like Windows (7,8,10), Linux (Debian, Ubuntu) and Mac OS X. Can be deployed on Servlets Containers like Jetty, Tomcat or Glassfish Application Server. JPI can be include in any Java Project using the commonest Java Integration Development Enviroment (IDE) like Eclipse, Netbeans, IntellijIDEA and so on.

JPI is developed and maintained by Prolobjectlink Project an open source initiative for build logic based applications using Prolog like fundamental Logic Programming Language in the persistence layer and application programming.

Getting Started


Install

Java Prolog Interface API is distributed with implementation adapter and concrete prolog driver library until it is possible according to related libraries licenses. The distributions are named normally such that prolobjectlink-jpi-jpl7-swi7-x.y.z-dist.zip meaning that this distribution is a JPI implementation over JPL version 7 or above and SWI-Prolog version 7 or above. The x.y.z is the distribution version. The distribution can be downloaded in zip or tar.gz compresses format. To install you need perform the following steps:
•Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8 or above.
•Install Native Prolog Engine compatible to Operating System and your architecture. If the Prolog Engine to use is Java-based this step is omitted.
•Configure System Path with Prolog Engine routes. If the Prolog Engine to use is Java-based this step is omitted.
•Download Java Prolog Interface compatible to related prolog engine and unzip the distribution over Operating File System.
•Configure System Path with JPI unzip folder route.
•Open a new System console and type pllink –i to see the product information. 
For the JPI beginners we recommended start with a Pure Java-Prolog Engine because have less configuration aspects and native engine are more difficult to link.

Getting started Java to Prolog

After installation and architecture compression you can use the hello world sample for test the system integration. This hello world sample show how interacts with JPI from Java programming language with Abstracted Prolog Engine. For the first experience we suggesting use a Java-based Prolog engine like tuProlog because have less configuration aspects.

Create in your preferred development environment an empty project. Set in the project build path the JPI downloaded libraries located at lib folder. Create a Main Java class that look like below code:

       public class Main {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                PrologProvider provider = Prolog.getProvider(SwiProlog7.class);
                PrologEngine engine = provider.newEngine();
                engine.asserta("sample('hello wolrd')");
                PrologQuery query=engine.query("sample(X)");
                System.out.println(query.one());
                }
        }
