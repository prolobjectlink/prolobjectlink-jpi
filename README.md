Java Prolog Interface (JPI) is an Application Provider Interface (API) for interaction between Java and Prolog programming languages. Is a bidirectional interface that communicate Java applications with Prolog program or database and Prolog procedures with Java class and methods.

JPI is an abstraction layer over concrete prolog drivers over Prolog Engines. This API define all mechanism to interact with any Prolog Engine and maintain the application independent to a specific underlying engine. JPI have several connectors to open source prolog engines like SWI, YAP, XSB native engines and tuProlog, jTrolog, jLog Java based prolog engines.

JPI study all related Java-Prolog integration libraries and take the betters features from each solution with the propose to achieve a common integration interface. The last feature allows switch the under laying Prolog Engine driver and the application code still be the same.

JPI run over any Java Virtual Machine that support Java SE 5 or above. The project was tested over HotSpot and Open J9 Virtual Machines over Operating Systems like Windows (7,8,10), Linux (Debian, Ubuntu) and Mac OS X. Can be deployed on Servlets Containers like Jetty, Tomcat or Glassfish Application Server. JPI can be include in any Java Project using the commonest Java Integration Development Enviroment (IDE) like Eclipse, Netbeans, IntellijIDEA and so on.

JPI is developed and maintained by Prolobjectlink Project an open source initiative for build logic based applications using Prolog like fundamental Logic Programming Language in the persistence layer and application programming.
